Evan Scheerer
Catawba College

I am a Computer Science student at Catawba College in Salisbury, North Carolina. At the moment I have only learened introduction skills to programming. I have worked with Sql and Python so far. Using Python I coded a simple application that can take a users choice and calculate tax along with other options. I have a few semesters to complete my coding skills. My goal is to learn at least 3 more languages soon and be fluent in all of them. You can contact me at (evanscheerer708@gmail.com) or use my school email (escheere22@catawba.edu).

I graduated from Southlake Christian Academy in Huntersville, North Carolina in May of 2020. I then attended Central Piedmont Community College my first two years of college online during covid. I then transferred to my current college which is Catawba College. My current degree is Computer Science and i will likely graduate in the spring of 2025.

My skills inlcude a begginner to intermiediate understanding of python and sql. I am very knowlegeable on computers aside from coding and can workout computer issue on my own if they aren't too complicated. 

I have earned Certifications from comleting DataCamp courses online. These are automated certifications when you have complteted a project or a certain milestone required. 

I am a part of NSLS (The National Society of Leadership and Success) which I have recently joined.

The only valid referrence so far in my education would be my teachers in school since I have not worked in the tech industry yet.
